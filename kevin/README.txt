Both approaches are still in progress, haven't gotten around to approach 2 yet.

You can run approach 1 by compiling the java code in the src folder under kevin. Then run Runner.

On a mac or linux/unix machine, it looks like this:
1. CD into src directory
2. javac *.java
3. java Runner

I'm not sure how to run this on Windows, but you should be able to compile it and run it however you normally do with java code.
